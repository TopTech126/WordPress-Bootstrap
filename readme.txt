/******************************************************************
Bones 
A Lightweight Wordpress Development Theme

Bones is designed to make the life of developers easier. It's built
using HTML5 & has a strong semantic foundation. It was updated recently
using some of the HTML5 Boilerplate's recommended markup and setup.
There are also a ton of bonus features such as page navi, breadcrumbs,
related posts, and html5 video with fallback. It's constantly growing
so be sure to check back often if you are a frequent user.
